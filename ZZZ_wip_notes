      THOR_PROTOCOL: https
      THOR_PORT: 443

and a KEYSTORE and PASSWORD for that
with no provider in my truffle config lets me deploy to vechain testnet

COOL TO HAVE:

 DONE? aws-exports needs to be pulled from the environment in the pipeline pre-build - 
finish adding repository branches, delete old branches, delete github app
test backend-eventlistener
DONE delete all env file secrets from backend env   --IMPLEMENT AWS SECRETS MANAGER READ VALUE FOR ENVIRONMENT -- done
DONE delete global service  -- done
DONE delete api keys  --
REMOVE BlockchainWalletService IN BACKENDEVENT LISTENER WALLET PASSWORD

DONE swap wallet to v2 sync
truffle build output file prefix for dev/test/prod

GENERATE NEW WALLETS WITH PASSWORD
ADD JSON KEYSTORE JSON TO SECRETS MANAGER
CHANGE APP TO READ FROM SECRETS MANAGER USING AWS-SDK
REMOVE FROM ALL READMES KEYSTORE & PASSCODE REFERENCES

wallets are for contract owner backend-eventlistener calls as 'onlyOwner' and donation access

try to install web3-gear python in WSL * WORKING
RUN:
WINDOWS POWERSHELL: docker cmd below

WSL UBUNTU: 
source thor-venv/bin/activate
web3-gear


test web3-gear and thor node running
docker run --rm -e THOR_IP=127.0.0.1 -e THOR_PORT=11235 vechain/web3-gear
docker run --rm --name mynode -p 127.0.0.1:8669:8669 -p 11235:11235 -p 11235:11235/udp vechain/thor solo --api-addr 0.0.0.0:8669 --api-cors "\*"

SMART CONTRACT DEPLOYMENT
      need to output keystore file FOR CONTRACT-OWNER only for web3-gear deployment to dev/test/prod to make calls & act as owner wallet to smart contract

APPLICATION FRONT END REQUIREMENT
      read in donation address but not any other information

APPLICATION BACKEND REQUIREMENT
      read in memory keystore for owner contract wallet service caller

THOUGHTS:
produce keystore for owner contracts for deployment - DO NOT check in anything in the deployment_keystore folder
write address files for front-end DONATION addresses - CHECK IN
change backend event listener process to read from aws secrets and produce keystore in memory for CONTRACT OWNER - check in


CHANGE FRONTEND FILES TO READ CORRECT LOCATION

WHEN CONFIRMED - DELETE wallets/old folder

DEPLOY CONTRACT TO DEV
DEPLOY CONTRACT TO TEST
DEPLOY CONTRACT TO MAIN

CREATE ALL THE WALLETS MANUALLY
DEVELOPMENT:
      CONTRACT OWNER
      DONATION

 TEST:
      CONTRACT OWNER
      DONATION     

MAIN:
      CONTRACT OWNER
      DONATION      
CREATE A NEW WALLET FOR EACH ADDRESS
